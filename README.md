- [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - A library for working with SQLite databases in Android, offering in-app object access and compile-time checks.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Used to store UI-related data that persists during configuration changes and helps schedule asynchronous tasks.
- [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/) - A library that simplifies in-app navigation by providing tools to handle navigation-related tasks.
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Enables the creation of data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes, making UI updates more efficient.
- [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android) - A library for rendering Adobe After Effects animations natively on Android.
